# MicroRSS

MicroRSS is a really simple RSS reader; given a file containing a list of
RSS feeds, it produces a HTML file containing links to the latest items
from all the feeds.

## Usage

Add the URLs of the RSS feeds that you want to subscribe to in the file
`feeds.txt` (one line per file) then run the `generate.py` script.
